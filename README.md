"I developed a comprehensive supermarket sales dashboard showcasing key metrics such as total profit, sales, and quantity. Additionally, I provided insights into monthly profit and sales trends, comparing year-over-year performance. The dashboard also offers a breakdown of sales by state and product categories like Furniture and Technology, including subcategories such as Phones, Chairs, and Binders. Furthermore, it highlights sales by shipping method, including First Class, Second Class, and Standard. This project enabled stakeholders to gain valuable insights into sales performance and make informed decisions."
